# Dynamic Programming

The big idea with dynamic programming is that we want to explore multiple possible
branches, but notice we can exploit the fact that there are overlapping sub-branches.
These means we can log data from those sub-branches (for instance, in a list of map),
that we can reference instead of recalculating each time.
