# Python Interview Patterns

My aim is to help you identify design patterns for the common structures and problem types you'll encounter in interviews
and on the job as an engineer. We will look at a variety of algorithms, but the goal will not be to memorize them,
but to take not of the patterns we see. When do we use 'while' loops? When do we use a dictionary vs. a list for memos?
By studying patterns will prime our creative minds to spot possibilites as we encounter novel problems.

This book assumes you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have been trying out problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have stirred up an authentic curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
theory and in the wild, as this journey will require your keenest pattern-matching skillz!
