# Python Patterns

My aim is to help you identify patterns that show up in the common data structures and algorithms you'll encounter in
technical interviews and on the job as an engineer. We will look at a variety of algorithms, yet now with the goal 
to memorize them, but rather to spot patterns. When do we use a 'while' loops? When do we use a dictionary vs. a 
list for memos? What is the overlapping subproblem in dynamic programming? By studying patterns we can prime our 
creative minds to spot possible approaches to novel problems.

This book assumes you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have been trying out problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have stirred up an authentic curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
theory and in the wild, as this journey will require your keenest pattern-matching skillz!
