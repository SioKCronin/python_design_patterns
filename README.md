# Python Quickstart

During my time as an Insight Data Engineering fellow, I met some of the brightest human beings I've ever encountered. 
Scientists. Statisticians. Engineers. All streaming into the field of Data Engineering. It was beautiful to behold.

I wanted to created a quickstart resource for building intuition with the common algorithms that show up in technical interviews,
so that smart people wouldn't get bogged down by this someone bizarre right of CS passage. The aim is to take a bird's eye view, 
so that can get started in a few hours tackling problems at the whiteboard.
