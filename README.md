# Python Prep

My goal with this mini-book is to help you identify patterns that show up in the common data structures and algorithms
problems you'll encounter in technical interviews and on the job as an engineer. We'll look at a variety of problems 
with the goal of spotting patterns. When should we use a 'while' loops? When does a dictionary work better than a list 
as a memo? What is the overlapping subproblem in dynamic programming qeustions? By studying patterns we prime our minds 
to spot possible approaches to novel problems, just as a shaman walking the woods trains themselves to spot medicinal plants.

These materials assume you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have tried out some problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have stirred up an authentic curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
the wild!
