# Python Quickstart

Technical interviews are designed to assess your knowleged of core computer science concepts, including data structures
and algorithms, as well as your ability to apply these concepts to novel problems. My aim is to help you identify design
patterns for the common problem types you'll encounter in interviews. This will help prime your mind for possible solutions, 
as well as provide you with a resource you can reference to refresh your memory before a screening or onsite. 

This book assumes you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have been trying out problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have cultivated an interest and curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
theory and in the wild, as this journey will require your pattern-matching skillz!
